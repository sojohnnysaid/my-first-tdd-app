    mini dice roll game:
        player inputs name and presses start round
        - check if player has played before display appropriate content
            yes:
                round he's now in (how many games he's played + 1)
                best score
            no:
                round: 1
                best score: 0
        - player presses roll dice
            a random number from 2-12 appears
        - player has 3 rolls
            show rolls left
        - Finally show total
            If total is greater than best score, update best score to equal the current total
